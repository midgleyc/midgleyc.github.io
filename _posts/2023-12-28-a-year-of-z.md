[Z](https://github.com/rupa/z) is a replacement to `cd`, that allows you to jump directly to a certain directory by providing a set of regexes. For example, `z kolm` takes me to the directory `~/thirdparty/kolmafia/`, and at work, `z les2 mgt` takes me to `~/ctg-twc/infrastructure-modules2/mgt`.

It works by tracking your most used ("most frecent", for frequent + recent) directories, then sending you to the most frecent that matches all the regexes you provide.

I've set it up on all my computers, and it's changed a lot: I now [no longer need to remember how to use a folder structure](https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z). I can just put things _somewhere_, and so long as I accessed it fairly recently, `z` will take me there (or `z -l` will show me the options).

I haven't yet set up my directories so they don't share short substrings, but this would be a good idea to make it convenient to ensure I can go places easily. For now, `z twc hyb` goes one place and `z hyb twc` another, and if I can't quite remember which is which, not much time is lost.
