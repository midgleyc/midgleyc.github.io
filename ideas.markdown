Ideas for posts I could write:
* Use factory methods instead of injecting concrete classes
* Where Java beats C# (enums, annotation processing, I like internal visibility without assemblies)
* Horrible Ideas #1: Linked files and the NHS banner API (manual testing)
* Comparison of culture in ASP.NET Core and Spring
* write up that list of things I tried when automatically populating review environment databases in Azure
* Azure DevOps horrible hacks (storing variables in the test name!)
